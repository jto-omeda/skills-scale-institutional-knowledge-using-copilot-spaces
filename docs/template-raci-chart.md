# RACI Chart Template

## Purpose
A RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) chart clarifies roles and responsibilities for project activities and decisions. Use this template to ensure clear ownership and communication expectations across your project team.

## RACI Definitions
- **Responsible (R)**: The person(s) who actually complete the work or task
- **Accountable (A)**: The person ultimately answerable for the correct completion of the task (only one A per task)
- **Consulted (C)**: People whose input and feedback are sought before decisions or actions
- **Informed (I)**: People who need to be kept informed of progress and decisions

## How to Use This Template
1. List all major activities/deliverables in the left column
2. List all roles across the top row
3. Assign RACI codes at each intersection
4. Ensure each activity has exactly one "A" (Accountable) person
5. Review with the team to confirm agreement and clarity

## Customization Notes
- Modify the roles columns to match your project team structure
- Add or remove activities based on your project lifecycle and needs
- Consider creating separate RACI charts for different project phases if needed
- Review and update the RACI chart as roles and responsibilities evolve

## Best Practices
- Keep it simple — too much detail makes the chart hard to maintain
- Focus on key decisions and deliverables, not every task
- Discuss disagreements openly to reach consensus
- Revisit the RACI chart during retrospectives if confusion arises
- Store the RACI chart in your project repository for easy team access
