# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Purpose

This documentation set serves as the central, standardized, and accessible source of OctoAcme's project management program knowledge for all stakeholders and contributors. It consolidates our delivery processes, workflows, roles, and best practices into a single, cohesive resource that enables teams to efficiently plan, execute, and deliver high-quality projects.

**This is the living source of truth for OctoAcme's delivery practices.** All team members are encouraged to consult these documents regularly and contribute improvements as our processes evolve. By maintaining this shared knowledge base, we ensure consistency across projects, reduce onboarding time for new team members, and continuously refine our approach based on lessons learned.

## Overview of OctoAcme's Project Management Processes

OctoAcme's project management framework is built on customer-first principles, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our approach emphasizes delivering value in small, testable increments while maintaining transparency and accountability across all stakeholders.

Our project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible path from **Initiation** through **Planning**, **Execution & Tracking**, **Release & Deployment**, and finally **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**. Each phase has defined deliverables, decision gates, and quality checkpoints that ensure projects stay aligned with business objectives. During initiation, we validate the business need through a lightweight Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, and stakeholder alignment. The planning phase transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with clear acceptance criteria, dependencies, and release timelines.

Throughout execution, teams follow consistent workflows using project boards, pull request conventions, automated testing, and quality assurance practices. **Risk management and communication** are woven throughout the lifecycle, with regular stakeholder updates, risk register reviews, and escalation paths for blockers. Our release process standardizes deployments through pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, and rollback procedures to minimize production incidents.

Central to our success are well-defined **roles and personas**: Project Managers coordinate delivery and manage schedules, Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Developers implement features with quality and testability in mind, and QA validates acceptance criteria. Additionally, Agile Coaches guide teams in Agile practice adoption and continuous improvement, Compliance Leads ensure regulatory adherence and risk mitigation, and Stakeholder Engagement Managers maintain proactive communication and expectation alignment across all stakeholders. After each release or milestone, retrospectives capture learnings and generate actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous enhancement. Our communication cadence includes weekly PM-PdM syncs, regular standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed, ensuring all parties remain informed and aligned throughout the project journey.
